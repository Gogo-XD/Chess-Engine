# Chess-Engine

This is a introductory custom chess engine built in C++. This was built for a friendly competition to see who could develop the strongest chess bot in a limited time. Features include: bitboards for storing gamestates, legal-move generation, custom evaluation function, deep tree searching, alpha-beta pruning, move ordering. There are future plans to improve the chess bot with further optimizations in zobrist hashing, multi-processing, improved evaluation, and more. Currently, I am building a front-end site to play the chessbot in a GUI.
